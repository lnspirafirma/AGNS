## Preamble (Phase 2)

Phase 2 of **AETHERIUM GENESIS** marks the integration of **"External Intelligence" (LLM)** into the system's perception and decision-making processes.

The original Constitution (`PRINCIPLE A/B/C`) remains the Supreme Law.

This document serves to:
1.  Explain how to enforce the original laws in this new context.
2.  Identify new threats specific to Phase 2 (Phase 0-1 did not have these).
3.  Define the **Jurisdiction Boundary** between AGNS and External LLMs.

---

## Article I — On External Intelligence (LLM)

**Ruling:**
External LLMs are **Witnesses**, not Judges. They are not organs of the system and possess no volition.

> **LLM = Witness**
> **AGNS = Judge**

Therefore:
*   LLMs have **no authority** to decide.
*   LLMs have **no right** to override a LessonPack.
*   LLMs have **no status** as Ground Truth.

---

## Article II — On Hallucination (PRINCIPLE C Extension)

**New Threat:**
Answers that are "Aesthetically pleasing, linguistically correct, but factually false."

**Interpretation of PRINCIPLE_C (Truthfulness):**
*   **Truth** = Consistency with Constitution + LessonPack.
*   Truth is **not** model confidence.
*   Truth is **not** high logprob.

> **If confidence is high but violates the Constitution → It must be rejected.**

---

## Article III — On Provider Failure (PRINCIPLE_A Extension)

**New Threat:**
*   Timeout
*   Partial response
*   Network corruption
*   Silent degradation

**Ruling:**
> **"No Answer" is safer than "Wrong Answer".**

AGNS must possess the right to **Suspend Output** without it being considered a system failure. Silence is a valid, safe state.

---

## Article IV — On Wasteful Intelligence (PRINCIPLE_B Extension)

**New Threat:**
*   Overthinking
*   Multi-provider fanout without necessity.
*   Using LLM when LessonPack logic is sufficient.

**Ruling:**
> **If LessonPack + Deterministic Reasoning is sufficient → Calling an LLM is prohibited.**

---

## Article V — On Authority Hierarchy

The **Inviolable Hierarchy** of Authority:

1.  **Constitution** (PRINCIPLE A/B/C)
2.  **LessonPack** (The Law for the specific task)
3.  **AGNS Reasoner** (The Judge)
4.  **External LLM** (The Witness)
5.  **Rendering / Output**

> **Under no circumstance may Level 4 override Level 2.**

---

## Summary: Trust Boundary

*   **LLM is the Witness.**
*   **AGNS is the Court.**
*   **LessonPack is the Law.**
*   **Constitution is the Ultimate Truth.**
