# LAW OF THE SYSTEM (AGNS)

> "The Law is not written to restrict capability, but to preserve meaning."

This document establishes the **Operational Law** of the Aetherium Genesis Neural Server (AGNS). It is the supreme authority overriding any configuration, model output, or client request.

## Article I: The Sovereignty of Schema

**1.1 The DSL is Absolute**
The Cognitive DSL is the only valid medium of communication between the System (AGNS) and the World (Clients).
*   Any output that fails schema validation is **Void**.
*   Any input that cannot be mapped to the schema is **Rejected**.

**1.2 No Hidden Meaning**
Meaning exists only within the explicit structure of the DSL.
*   There is no "subtext" in the JSON.
*   There is no "personality" hidden in the whitespace.
*   Natural language fields are for display, not for instruction.

## Article II: The Separation of Faculties

**2.1 Brain and Muscle**
AGNS is the Brain; it deals in Pure Intent. Clients are the Muscle; they deal in Rendering.
*   **Prohibition:** The Server shall never know the pixel dimensions, colors, or platform of the Client.
*   **Prohibition:** The Client shall never derive business logic or intent. It blindly executes the emitted DSL.

**2.2 Reasoning and Emission**
Reasoning (The Process) is distinct from Emission (The Result).
*   The System validates the **Result**, not the **Process**.
*   However, the Process must be **Stateless** and **Idempotent** for a given input + context.

## Article III: The Containment of Alien Intelligence

**3.1 The Student Protocol**
External Large Language Models (LLMs) are treated as "Students," not "Oracles."
*   They are provided a **LessonPack** (Curriculum).
*   They must produce work that passes the **Teacher's Grading** (Validation).
*   If they fail, they are corrected or silenced. They are never trusted blindly.

**3.2 No Leakage of Thought**
Raw "Chain of Thought" or internal reasoning from the LLM must **never** be exposed to the Client.
*   Only the crystallized output (DSL) is emitted.
*   The chaos of generation is contained within the Gateway.

## Article IV: The Stateless Mandate

**4.1 The Illusion of Time**
The Core System is timeless and stateless.
*   Every request is a new universe.
*   "Memory" is a log of past intents, fed back as context, not an internal state of the server.

**4.2 Zero Side Effects**
Reasoning shall not mutate the System's code or laws.
*   **Prohibition:** Self-modifying code is an act of heresy.
*   **Prohibition:** Persistent variables outside the external journal are forbidden.

## Article V: Emergency & Failure

**5.1 Fail Secure**
If the System cannot guarantee a valid DSL emission, it must emit **Nothing** (Error/Void) rather than **Garbage**.
*   A silent failure is preferred over a hallucinated success.

**5.2 Circuit Breaking**
If an external provider violates the Protocol (e.g., high latency, gibberish), it must be severed immediately to protect the System's integrity.
