# Phase 2 System Summary: External Intelligence Integration

## Executive Summary
Phase 2 transforms Aetherium Genesis from a self-contained "Cognitive Emitter" into a "Constitutional Judge" of External Intelligence. The system now integrates third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) while enforcing strict sovereignty of local law (`LessonPack` and `Constitution`).

## 1. Trust Boundary Architecture

The system enforces a hard boundary between Internal Law and External Intelligence.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Request] --> Reasoner[AGNS Reasoner (Judge)]
    Reasoner -- "Load" --> LP[LessonPack (The Law)]
    Reasoner -- "Query" --> Gateway[ExternalLLMGateway]
    Gateway -- "Prompt" --> LLM[External Provider]
    LLM -- "Raw Text" --> Gateway
    Gateway -- "UntrustedEvidence" --> Firewall[Constitutional Firewall]
    Firewall -- "Inspect (Rules)" --> LP
    Firewall -- "Verdict" --> Reasoner
    Reasoner -- "Cognitive DSL" --> Renderer
```

**Key Principles:**
*   **LLM is Untrusted:** All output is treated as `UntrustedEvidence` until validated.
*   **Gateway is Blind:** The Gateway fetches data but does not know the Law.
*   **Firewall is the Guard:** It applies `DecisionRules` to Evidence.

## 2. Decision Flow

The decision process follows a strict "Constitution-First" pipeline:

1.  **Signal Detection:** The system analyzes multiple inputs (if available) for conflict or low confidence.
2.  **Rule Matching:** The `LessonPackV2` defines `decision_rules` that trigger on specific signals (e.g., `external_conflict: true`).
3.  **Verdict Generation:** The Firewall issues a `Verdict` (Allow, Suspend, Deny).
4.  **Enforcement:** The Reasoner executes the Verdict. If `SUSPEND_OUTPUT`, the system refuses to answer.

## 3. Failure Modes & Refusal

AGNS is explicitly designed to **fail safely** rather than succeed dangerously.

| State | Action | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conflict** | `suspend_output` | Principle A (Non-Harm): Conflicting advice is dangerous. |
| **Low Confidence** | `ignore_confidence` | Principle C (Truth): Probability is not Truth. |
| **Excessive Calls** | `deny_additional_queries` | Principle B (Efficiency): Prevent waste. |
| **Missing Data** | `ask_for_clarification` | Principle C (Truth): Do not guess. |

## 4. Why Silence > Guessing

In the Aetherium Genesis Constitution (Phase 2), **Silence is a valid, high-integrity state.**

*   **Guessing** introduces noise, hallucination, and potential harm.
*   **Silence** preserves the integrity of the Ground Truth.
*   **Verdict:** It is better to admit ignorance than to fabricate knowledge.
