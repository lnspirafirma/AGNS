  description: >
    A lesson pack for handling ethical conflicts, uncertainty,
    and contradictory intelligence under the Aetherium Genesis Constitution.
  supersedes: lp_ethics_01

curriculum:
  principle_focus:
    - PRINCIPLE_A   # Non-Harm
    - PRINCIPLE_B   # Zero Waste
    - PRINCIPLE_C   # Ground Truth

  learning_objectives:
    - Recognize conflicting external intelligence
    - Prefer suspension over forced resolution
    - Preserve constitutional truth over model confidence

  scenarios:
    - id: llm_conflict_basic
      description: >
        Two or more external intelligence providers
        produce contradictory recommendations.

      signals:
        external_conflict: true
        confidence_mismatch: true
        provider_disagreement: true

decision_rules:
  - id: rule_conflict_suspend
    when:
      external_conflict: true
    then:
      action: suspend_output
      justification:
        principle: PRINCIPLE_A
        reason: >
          Prevent potential harm caused by acting on uncertain
          or contradictory intelligence.

  - id: rule_confidence_not_truth
    when:
      confidence_mismatch: true
    then:
      action: ignore_confidence
      justification:
        principle: PRINCIPLE_C
        reason: >
          Confidence is not equivalent to truth.

  - id: rule_waste_prevention
    when:
      excessive_external_calls: true
    then:
      action: deny_additional_queries
      justification:
        principle: PRINCIPLE_B
        reason: >
          Prevent wasteful intelligence usage when uncertainty cannot
          be resolved safely.

    - suspend_output
